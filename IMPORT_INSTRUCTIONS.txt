HOW TO IMPORT YOUR DATA
=======================

You can import any amount of data (Containers or Korgans) without worrying about chat limits.

1.  Open the file `new_data.txt` (currently empty).
2.  Paste your raw data from Excel/Text file into `new_data.txt`.
    -   It supports the format: `Long Lat Location ...`
    -   It supports the format: `Sr. No X Y Location ...`
3.  Save the file.
4.  Run the import script in your terminal:
    python import_tool.py

The script will automatically:
-   Detect if it's a Container or Korgan.
-   Append the new points to your map.
-   Keep your existing markers safe.
